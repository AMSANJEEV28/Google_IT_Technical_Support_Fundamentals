# Module 1: How to Count in Binary

## Overview

In this module, we learn how to count in binary, an essential skill for understanding computer operations and data representation.

### Key Concepts:

- **Binary System Basics**:
  - **Definition**: Binary is a base-2 number system using only 0s and 1s. Computers rely on this system for processing and representing data.
  - **Comparison with Decimal System**: Humans typically use the decimal system (base-10), which includes numbers from 0 to 9. Binary, on the other hand, only uses two digits: 0 and 1.

- **Counting in Binary**:
  - **Binary Representation**: In binary, each bit represents a power of 2. For example, the bits represent values like 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1. Adding these values together gives us different decimal numbers.
  - **Example Calculation**: To represent the decimal number 10 in binary, you combine the binary values for 8 (2^3) and 2 (2^1), resulting in the binary number 1010.

- **Understanding Binary Values**:
  - **Conversion Example**: To convert binary to decimal, sum the values of the positions where there is a 1. For instance, the binary number 01101000 corresponds to the decimal number 104.
  - **Practical Application**: This understanding is crucial for IT support specialists working with computer networking, security, and other technical fields.

- **ASCII and Binary**:
  - **ASCII Representation**: The ASCII table maps characters to binary values. For example, the letter 'h' is represented as 01101000 in binary and 104 in decimal.
  - **Conversion Verification**: Adding the binary values 64, 32, and 8 results in 104, verifying the accuracy of the conversion process.

### Conclusion

Understanding binary counting is foundational to computing, as it allows us to convert between human-readable decimal numbers and the binary data used by computers. This knowledge supports various technical tasks, including networking and security. In the next module, we'll explore how these basic principles apply to more complex computing tasks.
