# Module 1: Character Encoding

## Overview

In this module, we delve into the concept of character encoding, a fundamental process that allows us to represent text, numbers, emojis, and more on our screens using binary values.

### Key Concepts:

- **Binary Representation**:
  - A byte can store 256 possible values, which are represented as zeros and ones.

- **Character Encoding**:
  - **Definition**: Character encoding maps binary values to human-readable characters, making text understandable rather than just a sequence of binary numbers.
  - **Function**: It acts like a dictionary for computers to translate binary values into characters.

- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**:
  - **Overview**: An early character encoding standard that represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks.
  - **Example**: The lowercase 'a' is represented as `01100001` in binary.
  - **Limitations**: ASCII uses only 127 values, which eventually proved insufficient for representing diverse characters from multiple languages.

- **UTF-8 (8-bit Unicode Transformation Format)**:
  - **Overview**: A modern encoding standard that builds on ASCII and supports a variable number of bytes for each character.
  - **Benefits**: Can represent a vast array of characters, including emojis, by using more than one byte when necessary.
  - **Foundation**: Based on the Unicode Standard, which provides a consistent way to encode characters from various languages and symbol sets.

- **Color Representation**:
  - **RGB Model**: Colors on screens are often represented using the RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model.
  - **Mechanism**: Colors are created by mixing different intensities of red, green, and blue. Each color channel is represented with 8 bits, allowing for a wide range of colors.

### Conclusion

Character encoding is essential for translating binary data into readable characters and symbols on our screens. From the early ASCII standard to the versatile UTF-8 encoding, these systems have evolved to accommodate a wide variety of characters and symbols, including emojis. Additionally, color representation in computers uses models like RGB to display a full spectrum of colors. In the next module, we will explore how these binary values are generated and processed.
