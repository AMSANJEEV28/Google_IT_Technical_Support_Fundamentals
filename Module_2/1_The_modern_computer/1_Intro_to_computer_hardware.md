# Module 2: Introduction to Computer Hardware

## Overview

Computers are integral to our daily lives, found in homes, workplaces, and even in our pockets. Despite their complexity, computers essentially perform calculations, process, and store data. This lesson introduces the basic components of a computer and their functions.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Basic Computer Setup**
   - **Components**:
     - **Monitor**: Displays visual output.
     - **Keyboard**: Input device for typing.
     - **Mouse**: Input device for navigation.
     - **Desktop Case**: Houses internal components.
   - **Additional Devices**: Webcams, speakers, printers.

### 2. **Hardware Components**
   - **Hardware**: The physical parts of a computer.
   - **Ports**:
     - **Monitor Port**: Connects to the monitor.
     - **Keyboard and Mouse Ports**: Connects input devices.
     - **Network Port**: Connects to a network.

### 3. **Internal Components**
   - **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**:
     - **Function**: Acts as the brain of the computer, performing calculations and data processing.
     - **Cooling**: Covered by a heat sink to manage temperature.
   - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**:
     - **Function**: Short-term memory used for temporary data storage while tasks are being performed.
   - **Hard Drive**:
     - **Function**: Long-term storage for data like music, pictures, and applications.
   - **Motherboard**:
     - **Function**: The main circuit board that connects all components and allows them to communicate.
   - **Power Supply**:
     - **Function**: Converts electricity from the wall outlet into a usable format for the computer.

### 4. **Laptop vs. Desktop**
   - **Laptop**: Contains similar components but in a more compact form. Includes a built-in monitor and keyboard.
   - **Internal Components**: Hidden inside the case for portability.

### 5. **Understanding the Anatomy of a Computer**
   - **Component Interaction**: All components work together to perform computing tasks.
   - **Mobile Devices**: Use smaller versions of desktop and laptop hardware components.

## Practical Insights

- **Component Functionality**: Knowing how each component functions aids in troubleshooting and repair.
- **IT Support**: A solid understanding of computer hardware is crucial for IT support roles, as it helps in maintaining and troubleshooting hardware-related issues.

## Summary

This lesson provides a foundational overview of computer hardware, setting the stage for deeper exploration into each component. Understanding these basics is essential for effective IT support and hardware maintenance.
