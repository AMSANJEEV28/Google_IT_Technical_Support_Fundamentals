# Lecture Notes: Power Supplies

## **1. Introduction to Power Supplies:**
- Computers require **DC (Direct Current)**, but the electricity from wall outlets is **AC (Alternating Current)**.
- The **power supply** unit converts AC into low-voltage DC, making it usable for computers.
- **Power Supply Unit (PSU)** components:
  - **Fan**: Helps in cooling.
  - **Voltage Information**: Listed on the side or bottom.
  - **Cables**: Connect to the motherboard and power the system.


## **2. Understanding Electricity Basics:**

### **2.1. Voltage (V):**
- Voltage is like the **pressure** in a water pipe.
- **Higher voltage** provides more power to the device.
  - Example: Plugging a **120V appliance** into a **220V outlet** can **fry** the device due to excessive voltage.
  - **Lower voltage** (e.g., 220V device into a 120V outlet) causes **slower performance** and potential long-term damage.

### **2.2. Current (Amperage or Amps):**
- Amps represent the **pull** of electricity by a device.
  - Higher amps allow faster charging, as seen in device chargers (e.g., 2.1A vs. 1A).
  
### **2.3. Wattage (W):**
- **Wattage** is the combination of volts and amps and represents the total power needed by a device.
  - **Too low wattage** can prevent your computer from functioning.
  - **Larger power supplies** are often preferred to ensure there's enough power for demanding tasks (e.g., gaming, video rendering).
  - Power supplies will only deliver what your system needs, so having more wattage than necessary won’t harm the computer.


## **3. Diagnosing Power Issues:**
- Power supplies can fail due to **burnouts, power surges, or lightning strikes**.
- Symptoms of a faulty PSU:
  - Computer doesn't power on or shuts down randomly.
- **IT support specialists** need the skill to diagnose and replace a **failed power supply**.


## **4. Key Takeaways:**
- **Voltage** = Push of electricity (higher = more power).
- **Amps** = Pull of electricity (more amps = faster charging).
- **Wattage** = Total power needed (ensure PSU has enough wattage for your system’s tasks).
- Regular **power supplies** are enough for basic tasks, but more demanding tasks require higher wattage.
- **Diagnosing power issues** is a critical skill in IT support, as PSU failures can cause system shutdowns or failures.
