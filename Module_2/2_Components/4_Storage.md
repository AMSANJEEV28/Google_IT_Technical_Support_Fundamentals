# Lecture Notes: Storage

## **1. Introduction to Data Storage:**
- **Bits and Bytes**: 
  - Smallest data unit: **bit** (stores one binary digit, 0 or 1).
  - **Byte** = 8 bits (can hold a letter, number, or symbol).
- **Data Sizes**:
  - **Kilobyte (KB)** = 1,024 bytes.
  - Example: **500 GB** hard drive can store ~165,000 music files (average music file = 3 MB).


## **2. Types of Storage Devices:**

### **2.1. Hard Disk Drives (HDD):**
- **HDDs** use spinning platters and a mechanical arm to read/write data.
- Performance is measured by **RPM (Revolutions per Minute)**.
  - Higher RPM = faster data transfer.
  - Example: **5400 RPM** HDD with 500 GB storage.
- **Disadvantage**: Prone to damage due to moving parts.

### **2.2. Solid State Drives (SSD):**
- **SSDs** use **microchips** to store data (no moving parts).
  - Similar in technology to **USB sticks**.
  - **Faster** than HDDs and have a slimmer form factor.
- **Disadvantage**: More expensive, typically with less storage capacity for the same price as HDDs.
- **Advantage**: Less prone to damage, faster read/write speeds.

### **2.3. Hybrid Drives:**
- **Hybrid SSD+HDD** drives combine the best of both worlds.
  - SSD used for system performance (e.g., booting the OS).
  - HDD used for less important data (e.g., file storage).


## **3. Storage Interfaces:**

### **3.1. ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment):**
- The most common hard drive connection interface.
  
### **3.2. SATA (Serial ATA):**
- Popular interface for HDDs, using a single cable for data transfer.
  - **Hot swappable**: Allows connecting/disconnecting without turning off the machine.
  - **Faster and more efficient** than older interfaces.

### **3.3. NVMe (NVM Express):**
- Created for faster SSDs that **SATA couldn't keep up with**.
- **NVMe** connects SSDs as an **expansion slot** for greater data throughput and efficiency (no cable required).


## **4. Key Takeaways:**
- **HDDs** are affordable but prone to damage due to moving parts.
- **SSDs** are faster and more reliable but more expensive.
- **Hybrid drives** offer a balance between HDD affordability and SSD performance.
- **SATA** is the most common interface for HDDs, while **NVMe** is designed for faster SSDs.
