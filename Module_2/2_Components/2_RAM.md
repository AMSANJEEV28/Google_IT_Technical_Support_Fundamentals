# Lecture Notes: RAM (Random Access Memory)

## **1. What is RAM?**
- RAM stands for **Random Access Memory**, the **short-term memory** of a computer.
- It temporarily stores data that is accessed quickly and frequently by the CPU.
- **Volatile memory:** RAM is wiped clean when the machine is powered off.
  - Example: Losing unsaved work during a power outage.

### **Key Uses of RAM:**
- Stores **programs** and **data** that are actively being used by the CPU.
- Allows for **multitasking**: The more RAM, the more programs can run simultaneously.
- Example: If your computer has **16 GB of RAM**, it can run up to 16 GB of programs simultaneously.


## **2. Types of RAM:**

### **2.1. DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory):**
- Most common type of RAM found in computers.
- Stores each bit in a **microscopic capacitor**, either charged or discharged (representing **1** or **0**).
- DRAM chips are placed on **memory sticks**, often referred to as **DIMMs** (Dual Inline Memory Modules).

### **2.2. SDRAM (Synchronous DRAM):**
- **Synchronized** with the system's clock speed, allowing faster processing of data.
- Successor to traditional DRAM, offering improved performance.

### **2.3. DDR SDRAM (Double Data Rate SDRAM):**
- Modern computers use **DDR SDRAM**, which processes data on both the rising and falling edges of the clock signal, effectively doubling data throughput.
- Commonly referred to as **DDR**.
  
#### **Versions of DDR RAM:**
- **DDR1, DDR2, DDR3, DDR4**:
  - Each new version is faster, consumes less power, and has a higher capacity than its predecessor.
  - **DDR4** is the latest and fastest type of RAM available for consumer computers, allowing faster execution of programs and better multitasking.


## **3. RAM and Motherboard Compatibility:**
- RAM sticks have a specific number of **pins** that must match the RAM slots on the motherboard.
- Always ensure that the **RAM** you purchase is **compatible** with your motherboard to avoid issues during installation.


### **Key Takeaways:**
- RAM is essential for multitasking and running programs efficiently.
- Different types of RAM, like **DRAM, SDRAM, and DDR**, each improve on speed and capacity.
- Faster RAM allows better program performance and the ability to run more programs simultaneously.
- Compatibility with the **motherboard** is crucial when selecting RAM.
