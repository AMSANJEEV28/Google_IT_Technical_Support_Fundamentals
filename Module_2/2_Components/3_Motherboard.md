# Lecture Notes: Motherboards

## **1. What is a Motherboard?**
- The **motherboard** is the **foundation** of a computer, connecting all components together.
- It allows the **communication** between the CPU, RAM, storage, peripherals, and expansion cards.
- Routes **power** from the power supply to the computer components.


## **2. Key Characteristics of a Motherboard:**

### **2.1. Chipset:**
- **Chipset**: Manages communication between the CPU, RAM, and peripherals.
- Two main chips:
  - **Northbridge**: Connects components like RAM and video cards.
  - **Southbridge**: Handles **I/O controllers** such as hard drives, USB devices, etc.
- In modern CPUs, the **Northbridge** is integrated directly into the CPU.

### **2.2. Expansion Slots:**
- Expansion slots allow users to upgrade and add **functionality** to their computer.
- Example: Installing a **graphics card** in the **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)** slot.
  - **PCIe** is the standard expansion slot in modern motherboards.

### **2.3. Form Factor:**
- The **form factor** defines the **size** and **layout** of the motherboard, affecting how many components can be installed.
- Common motherboard form factors:
  - **ATX (Advanced Technology Extended)**: The most common form factor, used in desktops.
  - **ITX (Information Technology Extended)**: Smaller form factor, commonly used in compact computers.
    - Variations of ITX include **Mini-ITX, Nano-ITX, and Pico-ITX**.
  - **Intel NUC**: Uses a variation of the **ITX board**, offering even smaller sizes.


## **3. Considerations When Building or Upgrading a Computer:**
- The **form factor** determines the amount of space for components and the type of **expansion slots** available.
- Compatibility with other components such as the **RAM module**, **processor socket**, and **graphics card** must be ensured.
  - Example: If a user has video problems, make sure the replacement graphics card fits the motherboard's expansion slot.
  

### **Key Takeaways:**
- The **chipset** on a motherboard controls the interaction between the CPU, RAM, and other components.
- **Expansion slots** like PCIe allow for upgrading components such as graphics cards.
- The **form factor** determines the size and functionality of the motherboard and what components can be installed.
- Ensuring compatibility between the motherboard and other components is crucial for repairs or upgrades.
