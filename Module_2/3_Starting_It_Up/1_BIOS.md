# Module 2: BIOS

## Overview
The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is essential for initializing hardware and starting the operating system on a computer. It is stored on a ROM (Read-Only Memory) chip on the motherboard and is non-volatile, meaning it retains data when the computer is off.

## Key Concepts

### BIOS vs. UEFI
- **BIOS**: Traditional firmware that initializes hardware and loads the operating system.
- **UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)**: A modern replacement for BIOS with better compatibility and support for newer hardware.

### Power On Self Test (POST)
- **POST**: A test run by the computer to check hardware functionality before BIOS initializes the hardware or loads drivers.
- **Beep Codes**: Sounds produced by the computer to indicate hardware issues. Different codes vary by manufacturer. Refer to the motherboard manual for specific codes.

### CMOS Chip
- **CMOS Chip**: Stores basic settings like date, time, and startup configuration. BIOS settings can be changed through the CMOS or BIOS settings menu, usually accessed by pressing a specific key during boot.

### IT Support and BIOS
- **BIOS Settings**: Often used to control boot devices and perform tasks such as reimaging a computer. Reimaging involves wiping and reinstalling an operating system from an external device.

## Additional Notes
- BIOS settings and beep codes can be crucial for troubleshooting boot issues and managing system configurations.
- UEFI is becoming more common and may eventually replace BIOS entirely.

For detailed procedures on interacting with BIOS or UEFI, consult your computerâ€™s manual or IT support documentation.
