# Module 3: Operating Systems

## Overview
This module focuses on operating systems, their components, and how they work with computer hardware. Youâ€™ll learn about the boot process, installation procedures for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X, and interact directly with Windows and Linux systems using Qwiklabs.

### Key Concepts:
- Components of an Operating System
- Boot Process of an OS
- Installing Operating Systems (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X)
- Interacting with OS (Creating files in Windows and Linux)


## Main Topics:

### 1. **Remote Connection and SSH**
- Understand how remote connections work.
- Learn the basics of SSH for secure remote communication.
- Understand how to make remote connections in Windows.

### 2. **Components of an Operating System**
- OS consists of core components like kernel, process management, memory management, file systems, and I/O management.
- Explore how different components interact with hardware and software.

### 3. **Files and File Systems**
- Files are stored in a structured system called a file system.
- Different OSs use different file systems (e.g., NTFS for Windows, ext4 for Linux, and HFS+ for Mac).
- Learn about specialized file systems like ReFS (Resilient File System).

### 4. **Process, Memory, and I/O Management**
- Understand how OS handles multiple processes and allocates memory to them.
- Learn about I/O management, which controls how devices like printers and keyboards communicate with the system.

### 5. **User Space and Logs**
- The User Space refers to areas where applications run, separate from the kernel.
- Logs track activities on the system and help with troubleshooting.

### 6. **The Boot Process**
- The OS startup process includes loading the BIOS, checking hardware, loading the OS kernel, and handing control to the user.
  
### 7. **Mobile Operating Systems**
- Overview of operating systems used in mobile devices like Android and iOS.
  
### 8. **Choosing an Operating System**
- Factors to consider when selecting an OS for different use cases: compatibility, performance, and hardware requirements.

### 9. **Virtual Machines**
- Virtual machines allow running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.
- Explore the basics of virtualization and setting up virtual environments.


## Practical Skills:

### 1. **Installing an Operating System**
- Step-by-step guides for installing Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X from scratch.
  
### 2. **Using Qwiklabs**
- Hands-on exercises for interacting with Windows and Linux OS in a virtual environment.
  
### 3. **Creating Files and Folders**
- Practice tasks: creating folders and files in both Windows and Linux environments.


## Key Takeaways:
- Understand the critical role of operating systems in managing hardware, software, and user interactions.
- Be able to install, configure, and troubleshoot various operating systems.
- Develop practical skills by working with OS features like file management, process control, and system logs.
